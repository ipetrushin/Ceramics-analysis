# Ceramics analysis
Pipeline for operational phase‑fractioning of Si–SiC–C in reaction‑bonded silicon carbide (RB‑SiC) from optical micrographs, reducing manual annotation while keeping industrially useful accuracy.
A scalable and interpretable solution for rapid RB‑SiC microstructure assessment and process screening.
Source IPYNB and PyTorch model are available for reproduce the results
